This dataset contains the Midnight Scanning Club (MSC) data, a dataset focused on the 
precise characterization of ten individual subjects via collection of large amounts of 
per-individual data. Each subject underwent twelve separate two-hour scanning sessions. In 
the first two sessions we collected four T1 images, four T2 images, four MR angiograms, 
and eight MR venograms. In the last ten sessions we collected five hours of resting-state 
fMRI data and over five and a half hours of task fMRI data across three different tasks. 
Participants also underwent extensive neuropsychological testing. These raw data are all 
provided here.

In addition to the raw data, we also provide several processed derivatives. These include 
cross-session-average T1 and T2 images linearly registered to atlas (Talaraich) space; 
cortical surfaces which were segmented from the T1 scans using freesurfer, hand-edited, 
and registered to fs_LR atlas space; resting-state data from each scanning session which 
has been fully preprocessed, motion-censored, and confound-regressed, provided both in 
volumetric (Talaraich) space and CIFTI (cortical: fs_LR32k; subcortical: Talaraich) space; 
cortical parcellations estimated from the resting-state data; vertex-wise whole-brain 
networks estimated from the resting-state data; myelin maps estimated from the T1- and 
T2-weighted anatomical scans; and matrices describing the physical geodesic/euclidean 
distances between every two points in the brain. Derivatives of the task data can be found 
at Neurovault.org.
