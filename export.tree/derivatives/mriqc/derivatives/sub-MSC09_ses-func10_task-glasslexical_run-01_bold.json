    "Instructions": "In the next scan you'll be performing 2 different types of task. You will only have to do one of these tasks at a time. The first task involves looking at patterns of dots. You will have to decide whether the dots seem to form a coherent, concentric pattern, or whether they are randomly distributed. You will indicate which you think it is by pressing a button on the button box. Please make this decision as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. At the start of the period in which you'll be doing this task, you'll see a green crosshair in the center of the screen, and to each side of it will be 'COHER' or 'INCOH.' This will let you know which button you should press if you think the pattern is coherent or incoherent, respectively. At the end of the task you'll see this same screen, which will serve to let you know that you are done performing that task for the scan. Do you understand? The second type of task you will perform involves making a semantic judgment about a word.  In this task you'll be shown a series of words, and for each you will judge whether that word is a noun or a verb. You will indicate which you think it is by pressing a button on the button box. Please make this decision as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. At the start of the period in which you'll be doing this task, you'll see a green crosshair in the center of the screen, and to each side of it will be 'NOUN' or 'VERB'. This will let you know which button you should press if you think the word is a noun, or if it's a verb. At the end of the task you'll see this same screen, which will serve to let you know that you are done performing that task for the scan. Do you understand? The order of the two tasks is random, so you may have to perform the dot pattern task first, or you may have to perform the word judgment task first.  Do you have any questions?",
