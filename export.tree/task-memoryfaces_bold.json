	"Instructions": "In this next scan you'll be viewing a series of faces. Some will be female, others will be male. Your task is to decide what the gender of each face is. You will see each face more than once. Regardless of how many times you have seen a face, please indicate whether it is male or female. You'll make your responses with the button box, with either your left or right thumb. Press the LEFT/RIGHT button to indicate that a face is female, and the RIGHT/LEFT button to indicate that the face is male.[Practice this a half dozen times by prompting them to press the button for male/female] Do you have any questions?"
