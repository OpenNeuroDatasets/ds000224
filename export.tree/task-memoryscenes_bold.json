	"Instructions": "In this next scan you'll be viewing a series of scenes. Some will be indoor scenes, others will be outdoor scenes. Your task is to decide whether or not each picture you see is of an indoor or outdoor scene. You will see each picture more than once. Regardless of how many times you have seen a picture, please indicate whether it is an indoor or outdoor scene. You'll make your responses with the button box, with either your left or right thumb. Press the LEFT/RIGHT button to indicate that a scene is indoors, and the RIGHT/LEFT button to indicate that the scene is outdoors.[Practice this a half dozen times by prompting them to press the button for indoor/outdoor] Do you have any questions?"
