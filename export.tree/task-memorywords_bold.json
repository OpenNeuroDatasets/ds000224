	"Instructions": "In this next scan you'll be viewing a series of nouns. Some will be abstract, others will be concrete. Abstract words refer to ideas that do not have a physical or set form. Concrete words are words for which a physical or set form exists. Your task is to decide whether each noun is abstract or concrete. You will see each noun more than once. Regardless of how many times you have seen a noun, please indicate whether it is abstract or concrete. You'll make your responses with the button box, with either your left or right thumb. Press the LEFT/RIGHT button to indicate that a word is abstract, and the RIGHT/LEFT button to indicate that the word is concrete.[Practice this a half dozen times by prompting them to press the button for abstract/concrete] Do you have any questions?"
